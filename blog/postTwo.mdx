Hello there? welcome to my other post.

Since 1959, the indestructible Land Cruiser didnâ€™t let anything stand on their way.
 A comfort while driving is ensured on one hand with their robust chassis that offers
  a solid foundation for responsive control. On the other hand, with their optimized
   suspension which allows a high load capacity and unprecedented off-road capabilities.
    Safety remains the top priority of the Land Cruiser 70, which is designed with a solid body,
     integrated airbags and large windows for full visibility. As powerful as it is adventurous,
      you can easily tackle the most difficult terrain aboard the legendary African 4x4.
